          <p>Once you've got <Link to='/equipment'>all the kit</Link>, it's time to get out on the road.</p>
          <p>Cycling is a team activity and there are a few things to bear in mind when riding with a club.</p>

          <h3>Hand signals &amp; Shouts</h3>
          <p>When you see someone make a hand signal or hear a shot, you should repeat it to pass the message on to the riders around you.</p>
          <p>Common shouts are:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Car back! - car approaching from the rear of the group</li>
            <li>Car up! - car approaching from the front of the group</li>
            <li>Slowing! - the group is about to slow down</li>
            <li>Stopping! - the group is about to stop</li>
            <li>Hole/Glass/Gravel! - someone spotted something too late or was travelling too fast for hand signals</li>
          </ul>
          <p>This video is a useful run-down of the most common hand signals.</p>
